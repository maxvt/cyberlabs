Editing the labs
----------------
The following tools might be useful to contribute to the labs' sources:
* dia files - [Dia](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Dia/)

All the sources are rendered into files usable by Prince, which means
.svg for vector files and .png for raster files.

Solutions
---------
This public repository does not include lab solutions. Please contact
the authors if you wish to obtain the reference solutions. Note
that the build system always generates both lab and solution files, even
when the sources do not include any solution-related markup.
