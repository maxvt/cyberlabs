    <h1>Password Cracking<span class="sln"> - Solution</span></h1>
	<h2>EC 521 Cybersecurity, Fall 2013, Lab 7</h2>
	
	<div class="lab">
    <p>This lab should be performed in groups of two students. 
    Solutions should be submitted electronically via Blackboard Learn.</p>

	<p>Password cracking is the process of recovering passwords from data 
    that have been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. 
    The purpose of password cracking might be to help a user recover 
    a forgotten password (though installing an entirely new password is 
    less of a security risk, but involves system administration privileges), 
    to gain unauthorized access to a system, or as a preventive measure by 
    system administrators to check for easily crackable passwords. 
    On a file-by-file basis, password cracking is utilized to gain access to
    digital evidence for which a judge has allowed access but the particular 
    file's access is restricted.</p>

	<p>In this lab, two powerful tools-John the Ripper (JTR) and Hydra-will 
	be introduced to perform password cracking. JTR is used for offline 
	passwords cracking and Hydra is used to attack a remote authentication 
	service on-line. By using these tools, students will learn common cracking
	techniques and understand how to identify weak passwords and construct
	web applications resistant to such attacks.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2 style="counter-reset: chapter">Offline Password Cracking</h2>
	<p>You will do experiments
	on Kali's password database, but the same techniques could apply to any
password database of the same format, as the last part of this section will demonstrate.</p>
	
	<ol><li>Locate a Linux command that lets you add new users to the system.
	Add a user with name <tt>pentest</tt> and password <tt>abc123</tt>. You can try
	logging in as this user to check everything was done correctly.</li>
	
	<q>Which two files are used to store user account and password information on Linux?</q>
	<q>What is the security risk that led to transition from a single file to two separate files?</q>
	
	<li>Use the <kbd>unshadow</kbd> utility to merge the user database into
		a single file that can be used by <em>John the Ripper</em>. Save the
		result into <tt>passwords.db</tt>.</li>
	<q>Add a screenshot of the <tt>passwords.db</tt> entry for the new user ("pentest").</q>
	
	<li><p>Run <em>John the Ripper</em> in console by typing <kbd>john</kbd>.
		First, you will try the dictionary attack (JTR calls it "wordlist") using
		a dictionary supplied with JTR on the user you have just added.</p>
		<samp>john --wordlist:/usr/share/john/password.lst --user:pentest 
--format=crypt passwords.db</samp>
		<p>Note the amount of time it takes JTR to crack the password, you will need it later.</p></li>
	<li><p>Use <kbd>john --show passwords.db</kbd> to see the cracked passwords. 
		This commands displays the cracked passwords that are stored, by default,
		in <tt>~/.john/john.pot</tt>.</p></li>
	<q>Add a screenshot of the results of the cracking effort.</q>
	<li><p>Now you will try a different method. First, the existing crack results need
	to be removed: <kbd>rm ~/.john/john.pot</kbd>. Then, run:</p>
		<samp>john –incremental:all --user:pentest --format=crypt passwords.db</samp></li>
	</ol>
	<q>How much longer does it take to crack the password in this way as compared to 
	a dictionary attack?</q>
	<q>What is the commonly used name for the attack you have just used? 
	(Hint: it is not "incremental attack")</q>
	<q>Why did you remove <tt>john.pot</tt> and what would happen if it was kept?</q>
	<q>What is the difference between the two attack methods?</q> 
	
	<p>Combine the password cracking techniques you have learned now and exploits you
	have seen in the Metasploit lab: </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Run Metasploitable. The only action you are allowed to take
		in Metasploitable's terminal is finding its IP address.</li>
		<li>Find and exploit a vulnerability in Metasploitable
	from Kali to obtain shell or filesystem access.</li>
		<li>Find a way to transfer the password files from Metasploitable onto Kali.</li>
		<li>Attempt to crack the retrieved password files and recover
	some username/password pairs.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Note: using a known username/password to log in to Metasploitable
		from Kali is not considered "finding an exploit".</p>
	<q>Provide full console logs (preferred) or screenshots of your actions.</q>
	<q>List the users/passwords that you have cracked.</q>
	
	<h2>Online Password Attack</h2>
	<p>In this section, you will use an online tool called <em>Hydra</em> to
	attack web applications running on Metasploitable and attempt to find out
	user/password pairs that will give you privileged access to those applications.</p>
	<p>For this part of the lab, Metasploitable must be running.</p>
	<q>Find the Metasploitable's IP address by using <tt>nmap</tt> only: scan
	the subnet of Kali for hosts and see which one is running a web server on
	the standard port. The answer should create as little traffic on the network
	as possible, in order to be less noticeable. 
	Submit a console log (preferred) or screenshots to justify your answer.</q>
	<p>See what <em>Hydra</em> can do by typing <kbd>hydra</kbd> on Kali.</p>
	<p>Now, let us apply <em>Hydra</em> to the tack of cracking some passwords on
	one of the web applications included with Metasploitable.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open the browser on Kali and navigate to Metasploitable's IP address.</li>
		<li><p>Go to <em>Mutillidae</em> and on to the login page. Check that
			the security level is set to 0 (Hosed) and hints are Disabled.</p>
		<img src="mutillidae-login.png" width="100%" /></li>
		<q>Which HTTP method is used when you attempt to log in from this page? Justify
		your answer. Give two different justifications for a bonus.</q>
		<li>Let's find out what the form submission format looks like. This
		is needed to configure Hydra correctly. One way to do it is by using
		Wireshark.</li>
		<li>Open Wireshark and start capturing on eth0. Type whatever you want 
		into Name and Password fields on the form still open in the browser; then press Login.</li>
		<li>Stop the capture and filter by HTTP protocol.</li>
		<li>Find the packet corresponding to the HTTP method you need and open the 
		contents.</li>
		<q>Copy here the contents of the form submission message (sent
		from Kali to Metasploitable), omitting
		any HTTP and lower level (TCP, IP, etc.) headers.</q>
		<li>By replacing the username you entered with ^USER^ and password with
		^PASS^, you will obtain the format string you need for Hydra.</li>
		<li>There's one more thing you need: a failure string, to let Hydra
		know when the attempt is (un-)successful. You can look for it in the
		HTML page source. We suggest using "Not Logged In" as a failure marker.</li>
		<li>Let's crack the password of the user <kbd>jeremy</kbd>. In the following
			command, everything is on one line; there is a space between lines 1 and 2
			but no space between lines 2 and 3 (<tt>?page=login.php:username...</tt>).
		</li>
		<samp>hydra –l jeremy –P[location of password.lst] –e ns –o mutillidae_passwords.found 
[Metasploitable IP address] http-post-form "/mutillidae/index.php?page=login.php:
username=^USER^&amp;password=^PASS^&amp;login-php-submit-button=Login:F=Not Logged In"</samp>
		<q>The choice of username <tt>jeremy</tt> was not random. How did we guess this could be a valid user name?</q>
		<li>You can see the cracked passwords in <tt>mutillidae_passwords.found</tt>.
			<q>Add a screenshot of the full contents of the cracked passwords file.</q>
		</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>Now, apply the methods you have just learned to attack a different web application
	included on Metasploitable called <em>dvwa</em>. You can find it by navigating to
"dvwa".</p>
	<q>Document your steps with console logs and/or screenshots. Include the recovered user/password combinations.</q>
	
	<p>You can follow a different method of extracting the parameters needed by Hydra (form
	format and the failure string) with the guidance of the following optional section.</p>
	
	<h2>Using <em>Burp Suite</em> to analyze web applications</h2>
	
	<p>This example is analyzing the <em>Mutillidae</em> web application, which you are by now beginning to be familiar with.</p>
	<p>Run the suite from the system menu: <tt>Applications &rarr; Kali Linux &rarr; Password attacks
	&rarr; Online attacks &rarr; Burpsuite</tt></p>
	<p>The Burp Suite works as a proxy on the attacker's machine, so you need
	to configure your browser's proxy settings accordingly.</p>
	<p>Iceweasel: <tt>Edit &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Network &rarr; Settings</tt>, 
	check <tt>Manual proxy configuration</tt> and set HTTP proxy as localhost 
	(127.0.0.1/8080) as shown below:</p>
	<img src="burp-proxy.png" width="100%" />
	
<p>In Burp: <tt>Proxy &rarr; Intercept off</tt>.</p>
<p>In the browser: refresh the webpage you're interested in. The IP address
of the webpage should now show in Burp. Point on it and <tt>Target &rarr; Add [ip address] to scope</tt>.</p>
	<img src="burp-add-to-scope.png" width="100%" />
 
	<p>To restrict the data shown, use <tt>Filter &rarr; Show only in-scope items</tt>.</p>
	<img src="burp-filter.png" width="100%" />
	
	<p>Now, do <tt>Proxy &rarr; Intercept on</tt>. In the browser, type whatever you want into 
	the login form, for example test/test. Submit the form.</p>
	<p>Go back to Burp, do <tt>Proxy &rarr; Intercept</tt>. Now you will see the form format.</p>
